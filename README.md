# Portfolio Website (<a href="http://www.rajujha.me">Link</a>)

Managing the portfolio site was always a pain if just frontend was used. Even for minute changes to be made, whole website code was to be formatted. I have used django for CMS (Content Management Service) to ease the pain of editing whole code for any changes.

I am basically working on making this project an opensource Portfolio Management System and will soon be releasing a multi functional and generic PMS (Portfolio Management System).
